No such category could be located (6/10/82). No other access point could be found.  The one 1791 and three 1792 sermons may not be by Ker.  Weis lists Ker dying in 1795 and Rom. 5, 1.st was preached in 1798.  There are two folders in the MdHi, one labeled [Joseph Ker] that contained the earlier sermons (1765, 1766, 1767) and the Rom 5. 1.st, the latter apparently having been misplaced in with the 1760 works.  There are seven sermons, four in one hand (the 1790's) and three in another (1760's).  The handwriting of the two groups is similar, but has been judged different because of differences in capital letter formation, a difference in the lower-case \"d,\" etc., as well as a difference in format.  The early sermons are all given titles, and the place and date of the delivery of the sermon is listed under the title on the first sheet.  The four later sermons record only a text on the \"title\" page and put the place and date at the end of the manuscript.  Also, the 1790 works are written on one leaf at a time and the 1760 works are inscribed across two leaves at a time.  No record of a =Joseph= Ker (assigned the earlier sermons and the Rom. 5. 1.st) can be found.  It seems possible that since the MdHi accession records list seven sermons of =Jacob= Ker, that the earlier sermons may well be his.  The places and dates can all be justified.  Assigning the later sermons to a particular minister cannot be done with any confidence at this time.  The MdHi records reveal no reason for a \"[=Joseph= Ker]\" folder.  The attribution to Ker of the later sermons, although extremely doubtful, is retained as a finding aid to these works in the MdHi's collections.

Neither the volumes nor the manuscript pages are numbered, but volume numbers are inserted here for the convenience of the reader.

Or he may have revised this sermon on that date.  Page 17, probably the inside of the original back cover, is missing.  A page numbered 18 is written inside the original cover, facing page number 1.

An addendum of eight pages for the funeral of an unnamed person friend of Bend's was probably intended for insertion into this sermon, but could have been used with an earlier sermon.  Another eight-page insert was originally written for the funeral of a young slave owner but was later adapted for general use.  It was probably intended as an addendum to this funeral, but could have been used with earlier sermons as well.

The sermon's date of delivery revises the commonly accepted dating of this building as 1797.  Several inserted pages, written after the first text had been completed, are sewn into this booklet in confusing order.  Between the pages numbered 28 and 29 are ten pages written in a larger, hasty hand by Bend, but page 28 leads directly into page 29, and these ten pages are an insert or a conclusion to the sermon written subsequently but before it was first delivered.  Page 30, about music, is written inside the front cover which finishes on the outside back cover.

For example, Bend refers to rulers' responsibility in bringing on war and misusing power.  The original sermon consisted of 29 pages.

Because of the damage, it is impossible to tell if the original text is complete, but the ending sounds incomplete.  The later insert of 4 unnumbered pages, dated April, 1798, completes the sermon as we now have it.  Pages 1-28 are complete but dog-eared.  Page 29 is missing.  Some passages of the sermon were bracketed by Bend for deletion from subsequent preachings.

They appear incomplete, but fragmentary sentences at the end of each probably led back to the original sermon at points not indicated by notations.  These inserts probably date from 1800 and 1809.  As reported in the Convention Journal of the Diocese of Maryland, 1797 (pp. 14-15), Bishop John Thomas Claggett divided the Diocese into Districts, each under a supervising clergyman appointed by him, to assist him in visitations and supervision of the Church in Maryland (as the Bishop was in poor health).  Bend was in charge of the Third District:  Baltimore and Anne Arundel Counties.  This sermon was written by Bend for use on his visitations.  It attacks Tom Paine, condemns France as an enemy of religion, refers (in the longer of the two inserts) to \"the wild theories of enthusiasm\" (Methodism), exalts the Episcopal Church as founded on the Bible and nearest to the doctrine of apostolic times, and urges a charitable spirit in dealing with attacks on the Church by other sects.  Some of the other topics addressed in the sermon are:  Bible, authority of; \"Watson's Apology for the Bible\"; Watson, Richard, (1737-1816), professor of divinity at Cambridge and Bishop of Llandaff; Church, duty to support; and Claggett, Bishop Thomas John, duty to support.","MdDA;","","Visitation-sermon","Q","Paine, Thomas;France, as enemy of religion;enthusiasm;Methodism;Episcopal Church, founded on the Bib","M","I","2167",""

John Wilkinson.  Ranney notes that, \"[s]ome of these 'Savoy' sermons bear notations that they were preached at St. Thomas's, certainly Cradock's church in Baltimore County, in the 1760's.  Others simply bear a date in the 1760's, which also places them at St. Thomas's, since the dates of composition were substantially earlier, all prior to Wilkinson's deportation and death in 1757.\"  Most sermons include notations that list serveral early 18th-century dates for the various deliveries of the sermons; the information included here identifies those notations that probably refer to the dates of Cradock's deliveries of the sermons.  Included here are those sermons that appear to have been preached at St. Thomas's and are among those believed by Professor David Curtis Skaggs to have been probably preached by Craddock: \"Self-Condemnation--Part 1,\" preached \"St. Thomas's August 1768\"; \"Self-Condemnation--Part 2,\" preached \"St. Thomas's August 1768\"; On Hebrews 12:14, preached \"St. Thom:'s April 1768\"; On Deuteronomy 32:29 Part 1, preached \"St. Thomas's September 1768\"; On Deuteronomy 32:29 Part 2, preached \"St. Thomas's Sep. 1768\"; On John 3:3, preached \"Septem 1767\" (lists D.o as place--may not be at St. Thomas's); On John 16:24, notation reads \"Preached in 1767 Jany[?] by R.T.C.\"; \"The Wisdom of God--Part 1,\" preached July 1767; \"The Wisdom of God in the Dispensa~on of the Gospel.

Two scholars, Professor David Curtis Skaggs and Mr. F. Garner Ranney, have worked extensively with the material, and we rely heavily on their advice; however, all determinations and possible errors are solely the responsibility of the editors.  Professor Skaggs' work on the sermons of Thomas Cradock includes \"The Poetic Writings of Thomas Cradock, 1718-1770,\" \"The Chain of Being in Eighteenth Century Maryland: The Paradox of Thomas Cradock,\" \"Thomas Cradock and the Chesapeake Golden Age,\" and \"Notes on Maryland Historical Society Manuscript Collections\" co-authored with F. Garner Ranney.  Ranney also has produced an unpublished history of the Cradock sermons entitled \"Notes Concerning the Cradock Collection of Sermons.\"  Ranney notes that five Cradock sermons were in the Maryland Diocesan Archives since the Rev. Ethan Allen obtained them in the nineteenth century.  The bulk of the sermons were obtained in March, 1971 from the Rev. Thomas Cradock Jensen (who was not related to Thomas Cradock), through the work of Professor Skaggs.  Professor Skaggs worked on the sermons briefly, and during which time, he sorted the sermons according to author.  He identified many of the sermons as having been written by Cradock, while others were identified as written by the Rev. John Wilkinson and preached by Cradock at St. Thomas church.  Skaggs' identification was further complicated because Cradock suffered a paralysis sometime around 1763, and he used an amanuensis for the rest of his life. Skaggs' division of sermons is generally retained in this bibliography.  F. Garner Ranney also sorted through, reconstructed and identified other sermons, complete or partial, as having been preached or written by Cradock.  The sermons catelogued here represent complete sermons or partial sermons that include the first page.  These entries included those that clearly were written by Cradock as well as those that either demonstrate evidence of having been preached by Cradock or which Skaggs identified as having been preached by him.  Also included here are those sermons clearly written by Wilkinson but which contain dating that indicates having been delivered by Cradock.  In addition to these complete sermons, significant fragments are included in the collection that have not been catelogued.  Approximately 62 pages comprise these fragments and include partial sermons, torn pages or separate leaves.","MdDA","","","Q","","M","I (Need to add/subtr","",""

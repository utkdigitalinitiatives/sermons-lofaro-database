No such category could be located (6/10/82). No other access point could be found.  The one 1791 and three 1792 sermons may not be by Ker.  Weis lists Ker dying in 1795 and Rom. 5, 1.st was preached in 1798.  There are two folders in the MdHi, one labeled [Joseph Ker] that contained the earlier sermons (1765, 1766, 1767) and the Rom 5. 1.st, the latter apparently having been misplaced in with the 1760 works.  There are seven sermons, four in one hand (the 1790's) and three in another (1760's).  The handwriting of the two groups is similar, but has been judged different because of differences in capital letter formation, a difference in the lower-case \"d,\" etc., as well as a difference in format.  The early sermons are all given titles, and the place and date of the delivery of the sermon is listed under the title on the first sheet.  The four later sermons record only a text on the \"title\" page and put the place and date at the end of the manuscript.  Also, the 1790 works are written on one leaf at a time and the 1760 works are inscribed across two leaves at a time.  No record of a =Joseph= Ker (assigned the earlier sermons and the Rom. 5. 1.st) can be found.  It seems possible that since the MdHi accession records list seven sermons of =Jacob= Ker, that the earlier sermons may well be his.  The places and dates can all be justified.  Assigning the later sermons to a particular minister cannot be done with any confidence at this time.  The MdHi records reveal no reason for a \"[=Joseph= Ker]\" folder.

The volumes originally had bookplates entitled \"Library of Augustine T. Smythe, Charleston, S. C.\" and were given the title \"Sermons on Various Occasions by the Rev. Paul Turquand, Rector of St. Mathews Parish.\"  The damage to the manuscripts at the gutter and margin of the sermons does not usually prevent a clear reading of the text.  Only a few words tend to be conjecturable unless otherwise noted.  Sections which are broken off but still interfiled in their proper place are not noted as defects.  Neither the volumes nor the manuscript pages are numbered, but volume numbers are inserted here for the convenience of the reader.  The bulk of the Revolutionary sermons are either among the undated manuscripts and contain no internal evidence to place them in that period or are missing.     The Rev. Turquand served as a member of the first Continental Congress of South Carolina and was an active member in the formation of the first constitution of South Carolina.

Neither the volumes nor the manuscript pages are numbered, but volume numbers are inserted here for the convenience of the reader.  The bulk of the Revolutionary sermons are either among the undated manuscripts and contain no internal evidence to place them in that period or are missing.     The Rev.

Only a few words tend to be conjectureable unless otherwise noted.  Sections which are broken off but still interfiled in their proper place are not noted as defects.  Neither the volumes nor the manuscript pages are numbered, but volume numbers are inserted here for the convenience of the reader.  The bulk of the Revolutionary sermons are either among the undated manuscripts and contain no internal evidence to place them in that period or are missing.     The Rev.

He noted a few times that it was preached in the upper left hand corner of page 1.  The first date entered there is April 10, 1789, so the sermon is catalogued under this dated.  But it appears to be an earlier sermon, since it is written in the first, overly-large hand he used in sermons of 1786.  It was almost certainly written at that time.  The omission of quotation marks around the text is another sign of the early authorship of the sermon.

Pages 29-38 were evidently added for a particular funeral of a mother and daughter who died in an epidemic, most likely that noted on the cover as \"Mrs. Cooper &c.\"  Page 39 of the sermon, an insert for page 27, is written inside the front cover, and page 38 is written inside the back cover. Several inserts are filed with this sermon, but they may have been intended as addenda to this or to some other sermon.  A four-page insert, apparently for use at the funerals of children, is filed with this sermon, but notes on the insert indicate that it may not have been intended to be used with a funeral sermon of August, 1791 [see entry # _____ (accession # 1845)] rather than with this sermon.  An eight-page insert may have been an insert for this sermon or for the August 1791 funeral sermon.  A twelve-page addendum intended for use at the funeral of an unnamed elderly lady may have been intended for this sermon, the August sermon, or possibly an even earlier sermon.  An addendum of eight pages for the funeral of an unnamed person friend of Bend's was probably intended for insertion into this sermon, but could have been used with an earlier sermon.  Another eight-page insert was originally written for the funeral of a young slave owner but was later adapted for general use.  It was probably intended as an addendum to this funeral, but could have been used with earlier sermons as well.  A final four-page addendum, for the funeral of James Usher, may also have been adapted specifically for use with this sermon or may have been filed with this sermon for convenience and actually used with one of the earlier funeral sermons.  Some of the topics addressed in the sermon are:  wicked, punishment of;punishment;God, counsel of;heaven, glories of;Philpot, Miss Ann, funeral of;Greene, Mrs. Vincent, funeral of;Armstrong, Mrs. Isabella;Mercer, Captain, funeral of;Mayo, Mrs., funeral of;Gash, Daniel, funeral of;Stocket, Mrs, funeral of;Spurrier, William Jr., funeral of;Craxall, Mrs., funeral of;Cooper, Mrs., and child, funeral of;Jones, Mrs., funeral of;Chapman, Nuthill;Usher, James, funeral of;","MdDA;","","Counsel of God & Future Glory","Q","wicked, punishment of;punishment;God, counsel of;heaven, glories of;Philpot, Miss Ann, funeral of;Greene, Mrs. Vincent, funeral of;Armstrong, Mrs. Isabella;Mercer, Captain, funeral of;Mayo, Mrs., funeral of;Gash, Daniel, funeral of;Stocket, Mrs, funeral of;Spurrier, William Jr., funeral of;Craxall, Mrs., funeral of;Cooper, Mrs., and child, funeral of;Jones, Mrs., funeral of;Chapman, Nuthill;Usher, James, funeral of;","M","I (Ask Ranney:  1) where are Govanstown, Carter, and E Bailey's?  2)  why does he think that \"Anne d/o Nuthill Chapman\" would refer to \"Mrs Jones, Elk-ridge\"?

This sermon is significant as a summary of typical views about friendship, class relations, and the roles and duties of masters and servants.  In Maryland, \"servant\" was the usual euphemism for slave, and much of the sermon applies in that context, although it deals also with apprentices and laborers.  The sermon ends with a summons to partake of communion.  See entry # _____ (accession # 1965) for a sermon in which Bend uses a slightly different approach to the same biblical text.

As reported in the Convention Journal of the Diocese of Maryland, 1797 (pp. 14-15), Bishop John Thomas Claggett divided the Diocese into Districts, each under a supervising clergyman appointed by him, to assist him in visitations and supervision of the Church in Maryland (as the Bishop was in poor health).  Bend was in charge of the Third District:  Baltimore and Anne Arundel Counties.  This sermon was written by Bend for use on his visitations.  It attacks Tom Paine, condemns France as an enemy of religion, refers (in the longer of the two inserts) to \"the wild theories of enthusiasm\" (Methodism), exalts the Episcopal Church as founded on the Bible and nearest to the doctrine of apostolic times, and urges a charitable spirit in dealing with attacks on the Church by other sects.

The text also suggests that wealth, power, and liberty come from God; that God's mercy & justice has been forgotten and that God will punish the impious and unworthy Christians who deny His attributes.  Cradock also suggests that in alarming times, humans must heed (anglicans) ministers and God's laws, and must use the Bible as guide.  Finally, the text discusses the perils of the French and Indian War and the resulting need for God's favour and the depredations of barbarous Indians spreading desolation.

John Wilkinson.  Ranney notes that, \"[s]ome of these 'Savoy' sermons bear notations that they were preached at St. Thomas's, certainly Cradock's church in Baltimore County, in the 1760's.  Others simply bear a date in the 1760's, which also places them at St. Thomas's, since the dates of composition were substantially earlier, all prior to Wilkinson's deportation and death in 1757.\"  Most sermons include notations that list serveral early 18th-century dates for the various deliveries of the sermons; the information included here identifies those notations that probably refer to the dates of Cradock's deliveries of the sermons.

"CRADOCK, THOMAS","(MD;","Epis.;","1718-1770","AAAA.[","","","","","","","","","","","","The manuscripts of the Thomas Cradock sermons are located at the Maryland Diocesan Archives, formerly housed in the Maryland Historical Society.  Two scholars, Professor David Curtis Skaggs and Mr. F. Garner Ranney, have worked extensively with the material, and we rely heavily on their advice; however, all determinations and possible errors are solely the responsibility of the editors.  Professor Skaggs' work on the sermons of Thomas Cradock includes \"The Poetic Writings of Thomas Cradock, 1718-1770,\" \"The Chain of Being in Eighteenth Century Maryland: The Paradox of Thomas Cradock,\" \"Thomas Cradock and the Chesapeake Golden Age,\" and \"Notes on Maryland Historical Society Manuscript Collections\" co-authored with F. Garner Ranney.  Ranney also has produced an unpublished history of the Cradock sermons entitled \"Notes Concerning the Cradock Collection of Sermons.\"  Ranney notes that five Cradock sermons were in the Maryland Diocesan Archives since the Rev. Ethan Allen obtained them in the nineteenth century.  The bulk of the sermons were obtained in March, 1971 from the Rev. Thomas Cradock Jensen (who was not related to Thomas Cradock), through the work of Professor Skaggs.  Professor Skaggs worked on the sermons briefly, and during which time, he sorted the sermons according to author.  He identified many of the sermons as having been written by Cradock, while others were identified as written by the Rev. John Wilkinson and preached by Cradock at St. Thomas church.  Skaggs' identification was further complicated because Cradock suffered a paralysis sometime around 1763, and he used an amanuensis for the rest of his life. Skaggs' division of sermons is generally retained in this bibliography.  F. Garner Ranney also sorted through, reconstructed and identified other sermons, complete or partial, as having been preached or written by Cradock.  The sermons catelogued here represent complete sermons or partial sermons that include the first page.  These entries included those that clearly were written by Cradock as well as those that either demonstrate evidence of having been preached by Cradock or which Skaggs identified as having been preached by him.  Also included here are those sermons clearly written by Wilkinson but which contain dating that indicates having been delivered by Cradock.  In addition to these complete sermons, significant fragments are included in the collection that have not been catelogued.  Approximately 62 pages comprise these fragments and include partial sermons, torn pages or separate leaves.","MdDA","","","Q","","M","I (Need to add/subtract from this account)","","keep",3077,9999

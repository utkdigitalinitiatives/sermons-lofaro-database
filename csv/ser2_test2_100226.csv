There are seven sermons, four in one hand (the 1790's) and three in another (1760's). The handwriting of the two groups is similar, but has been judged different because of differences in capital letter formation, a difference in the lower-case \"d,\" etc., as well as a difference in format.

John Wilkinson. Ranney notes that, \"[s]ome of these 'Savoy' sermons bear notations that they were preached at St. Thomas's, certainly Cradock's church in Baltimore County, in the 1760's. Others simply bear a date in the 1760's, which also places them at St. Thomas's, since the dates of composition were substantially earlier, all prior to Wilkinson's deportation and death in 1757.\" Most sermons include notations that list serveral early 18th-century dates for the various deliveries of the sermons; the information included here identifies those notations that probably refer to the dates of Cradock's deliveries of the sermons.

Mr. F. Garner Ranney suggests, however, that other persons may have authored the some of the texts.  In his \"Notes concerning the Cradock Collection of sermons,\" Ranney writes that Professor Skaggs sorted the Cradock sermons into those believed to have been by Cradock, those possibly or probably by Cradock, and those by other authors, \"principally sermons preached in England, at the Savoy Chapel and other places.\"  Ranney says that Skaggs idendified the \"Savoy\" sermons as being by the Rev. John Wilkinson.  Ranney notes that, \"[s]ome of these 'Savoy' sermons bear notations that they were preached at St. Thomas's, certainly Cradock's church in Baltimore County, in the 1760's.  Others simply bear a date in the 1760's, which also places them at St. Thomas's, since the dates of composition were substantially earlier, all prior to Wilkinson's deportation and death in 1757.\"  Most sermons include notations that list serveral early 18th-century dates for the various deliveries of the sermons; the information included here identifies those notations that probably refer to the dates of Cradock's deliveries of the sermons.  Included here are those sermons that appear to have been preached at St. Thomas's and are among those believed by Professor David Curtis Skaggs to have been probably preached by Craddock: \"Self-Condemnation--Part 1,\" preached \"St. Thomas's August 1768\"; \"Self-Condemnation--Part 2,\" preached \"St. Thomas's August 1768\"; On Hebrews 12:14, preached \"St. Thom:'s April 1768\"; On Deuteronomy 32:29 Part 1, preached \"St. Thomas's September 1768\"; On Deuteronomy 32:29 Part 2, preached \"St. Thomas's Sep. 1768\"; On John 3:3, preached \"Septem 1767\" (lists D.o as place--may not be at St. Thomas's); On John 16:24, notation reads \"Preached in 1767 Jany[?] by R.T.C.\"; \"The Wisdom of God--Part 1,\" preached July 1767; \"The Wisdom of God in the Dispensa~on of the Gospel.

Two scholars, Professor David Curtis Skaggs and Mr. F.

Ranney also has produced an unpublished history of the Cradock sermons entitled \"Notes Concerning the Cradock Collection of Sermons.\" Ranney notes that five Cradock sermons were in the Maryland Diocesan Archives since the Rev. Ethan Allen obtained them in the nineteenth century. The bulk of the sermons were obtained in March, 1971 from the Rev. Thomas Cradock Jensen (who was not related to Thomas Cradock), through the work of Professor Skaggs. Professor Skaggs worked on the sermons briefly, and during which time, he sorted the sermons according to author. He identified many of the sermons as having been written by Cradock, while others were identified as written by the Rev. John Wilkinson and preached by Cradock at St. Thomas church. Skaggs' identification was further complicated because Cradock suffered a paralysis sometime around 1763, and he used an amanuensis for the rest of his life. Skaggs' division of sermons is generally retained in this bibliography. F. Garner Ranney also sorted through, reconstructed and identified other sermons, complete or partial, as having been preached or written by Cradock. The sermons cataloged here represent complete sermons or partial sermons that include the first page. These entries included those that clearly were written by Cradock as well as those that either demonstrate evidence of having been preached by Cradock or which Skaggs identified as having been preached by him. Also included here are those sermons clearly written by Wilkinson but which contain dating that indicates having been delivered by Cradock.

On the next page (31), he switches back to use \"her\" and \"She\".  Clay uses abbreviations throughout the sermon.","","","ViHi (Clay family papers, 1769-1951.

According to Greenâ€™s manuscript journal of the trip (see accession number 4065), he â€œSet out from Trentonâ€ on November 1, 1762 and â€œAr[r]ived at Hanoverâ€ on November  12, 1762 (p. 1).  He returned to New Jersey according to his â€œJournalâ€ six months later:  â€œ[May] 13 [1763] arived at Rev Mr Finleys at Head of Elk.â€ (p. 9) for a Synod.  William Tennent, Jr. was also expected to make such a missionary trip, but apparently never did.  <i>Records of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America</i> (1904; rpt. New York:  Arno Press, 1969) records on May 20, 1763, that â€œMr. Green fulfilled his appointments to Virginia.   Mr. William Tennent, jun. not fulfilling his, is excused.â€ (p. 325).  The volumeâ€™s index contains 21 other references to Green in the records.  [See also Alfred Nevin, ed., <i>Encyclopedia of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America:  Including the Northern and Southern Assemblies</i> (Philadelphia:  Presbyterian Encyclopedia Publishing Company, 1884, 276.]  The material at Rutgers, which includes â€œA Journal of my Mission to Virginia,â€ also includes notes on the collection by Donald Sinclair, Rutgersâ€™ first head of Special Collections citing the strong chain of evidence for the attribution of these works to Green.  According to Keith L. Griffin, the author of <i>Revolution and Religion:  American Revolutionary War and the Reformed Clergy</i> (New York:  Paragon House, 1994), Green  went beyond most ministers to claim that the colonists would succeed in the Revolution  because as Whigs they were the inheritors of the English Puritan revolution against the Tories, but later modified his claim as to the historical source of rights (pp. 57-58).  See also Joseph S. Tiedemann, â€œPresbyterianism and the American Revolution in the Middle Colonies,â€ <i>Church History</i> 74: 2 (2005), 322.  More information on Green can be found online at http://home.comcast.net/~williamgreenhouse/gen/40.hyml.  The Beatty Family Collection in the Special Collections of Princeton University (Mss. C1010, box 1, folder 2) has a leaf noting that Green was â€œdismissed from N Brunswick Presbytery April 22d. 1767â€”to join the Presbytery of Philadelphia.â€  The same collection holds two 1774 letters of the Rev. Charles C. Beatty to Green (Box 1, folders 5 and 6), a 1772 letter of John Beatty to Green and his family (Box 1, folder 7), and R. Beattyâ€™s  1775 letter to Green on Tories and tea (Box 1, folder 19).  Princetonâ€™s Hunter Family Collection (Mss. C1086, Box1, folder 1) contains a 1770 letter to Green from the Rev. Andrew Hunter.   Green also evidently ran a teaching academy at which Joseph Bloomfield, Governor of New Jersey (1801-1812) and later general and congressman, was educated (online finding aid, Princeton University Mss. Collection C1001).  Green eventually served as a chaplain in the Revolutionary War with Washingtonâ€™s troops at Fort Washington in New York City, but contracted camp fever.  Returning to New Jersey, he died on December 2, 1776.  A 1772 printed sermon of Greenâ€™s that survives is <i>Slothfulness reproved, and The Example of the Saints proposed for Imitation:  A Sermon, Occasioned by the Death of the Reverend Mr. William Ramsay, Who departed this Life November 5, 1771.  In the 39th Year of his Age.  Delivered at Fairfield in Cohansie, December 9, 1771.</i>  (Philadelphia:  Printed by D. Hall, and W. Sellers, in Market-street, MDCCLXXII).  Greenâ€™s text is â€œHebrews vi. 12.â€ and the sermon is available online (and in other forms of the Evans Early American Imprints, Series I , no. 12407) at http://opac.newsbank.com/select/evans/12407.

His record of service and death date the clearly patriotic manuscript to 1775-1776.  In his <i>Revolution and Religion:  American Revolutionary War and the Reformed Clergy</i> (New York:  Paragon House, 1994), Keith L. Griffin considers the work a single sermon and dates it to 1776 (p. 105, n. 17).  Greenâ€™s letter to his father, quoted in part below, may argue for a dating of 1775.  And, although cataloged and protectively sleeved as one work, it may in fact be three.  The first, that begins with the words â€œAt a Day of publick Danger & Calam[ity],â€ is complete in 8 pages, notes Greenâ€™s appointment as chaplain, and it concludes occupying only the top half of the eighth page.  The second, which is on slightly larger paper and initially written in the same but larger hand with more space between the lines, begins with â€œWe [symbol for â€œareâ€] now reduced to the dreadful Necess[ity] to determine [symbol for â€œthisâ€] Contest by ye Swordâ€ and may be complete or be the final four pages of a different address.  The third possible address is written on paper that is 1 Â½â€ shorter in length than the others.  It begins with â€œIt must afford great Pleas[ure] to every Lover of his Count. [Country]â€ and may be complete or be the final pages of a different address.  It concludes occupying only the top quarter of the final page.  The latter two works, if fragmentary, may be sermons, but unless beginning pages with Biblical texts are found, the more likely possibility remains that inscribed on these twenty pages are three distinct addresses.  This folder also contains a letter from Green to his father William (whose address is â€œTrentonâ€) that was written from â€œDeerfield 10th of September 1775.â€  It is, in effect a last goodbye and will.  He begins the letter â€œI am now reduced Very weak and low, and do soon expect to leave this World, My Wife a Disconsolate Widow and two Fatherless Children, whom I recommend to Divine Providence and Your Care.â€  He left New York and returned to New Jersey, dying on December 2, 1776.

No such category could be located (6/10/82). No other access point could be found, but see Ker's \"The One Thing Needful' (accession number 950). The one 1791 and three 1792 sermons (accession numbers 898 and 899, 900, and 901) may not be by Ker. Weis lists Ker dying in 1795 and Rom. 5, 1.st was preached in 1798. There are two folders in the MdHi, one labeled [Joseph Ker] that contained the earlier sermons (1765, 1766, 1767) and the Rom 5. 1.st, the latter apparently having been misplaced in with the 1760 works. There are seven sermons, four in one hand (the 1790's) and three in another (1760's). The handwriting of the two groups is similar, but has been judged different because of differences in capital letter formation, a difference in the lower-case \"d,\" etc., as well as a difference in format. The early sermons are all given titles, and the place and date of the delivery of the sermon is listed under the title on the first sheet. The four later sermons record only a text on the \"title\" page and put the place and date at the end of the manuscript. Also, the 1790 works are written on one leaf at a time and the 1760 works are inscribed across two leaves at a time. No record of a <i>Joseph</i> Ker (assigned the earlier sermons and the Rom. 5. 1.st) can be found. It seems possible that since the MdHi accession records list seven sermons of <i>Jacob</i> Ker, that the earlier sermons may well be his. The places and dates can all be justified. Assigning the later sermons to a particular minister cannot be done with any confidence at this time. The MdHi records reveal no reason for a \"[<i>Joseph</i> Ker]\" folder. The attribution to Ker of the later sermons, although extremely doubtful, is retained as a finding aid to these works in the MdHi's collections.

He was in Maryland from 1766-1768 and may have served this parish during the years noted on the cover.  The interlined notes are attributed to a son of Read's.    The short sermon at the back of the booklet is in a different hand, and may have been by Rev. <i>Thomas</i> Read.  See entry numbers _____ and _____ (accession numbers 904a and 905).

Pages 29-38 were evidently added for a particular funeral of a mother and daughter who died in an epidemic, most likely that noted on the cover as \"Mrs. Cooper &c.\"  Page 39 of the sermon, an insert for page 27, is written inside the front cover, and page 38 is written inside the back cover. Several inserts are filed with this sermon, but they may have been intended as addenda to this or to some other sermon.  A four-page insert, apparently for use at the funerals of children, is filed with this sermon, but notes on the insert indicate that it may not have been intended to be used with a funeral sermon of August, 1791 [see entry # _____ (accession # 1845)] rather than with this sermon.  An eight-page insert may have been an insert for this sermon or for the August 1791 funeral sermon.  A twelve-page addendum intended for use at the funeral of an unnamed elderly lady may have been intended for this sermon, the August sermon, or possibly an even earlier sermon.  An addendum of eight pages for the funeral of an unnamed person friend of Bend's was probably intended for insertion into this sermon, but could have been used with an earlier sermon.  Another eight-page insert was originally written for the funeral of a young slave owner but was later adapted for general use.  It was probably intended as an addendum to this funeral, but could have been used with earlier sermons as well.  A final four-page addendum, for the funeral of James Usher, may also have been adapted specifically for use with this sermon or may have been filed with this sermon for convenience and actually used with one of the earlier funeral sermons.

Two scholars, Professor David Curtis Skaggs and Mr. F. Garner Ranney, have worked extensively with the material, and we rely heavily on their advice; however, all determinations and possible errors are solely the responsibility of the editors. Professor Skaggs' work on the sermons of Thomas Cradock includes \"The Poetic Writings of Thomas Cradock, 1718-1770,\" \"The Chain of Being in Eighteenth Century Maryland: The Paradox of Thomas Cradock,\" \"Thomas Cradock and the Chesapeake Golden Age,\" and \"Notes on Maryland Historical Society Manuscript Collections\" co-authored with F. Garner Ranney. Ranney also has produced an unpublished history of the Cradock sermons entitled \"Notes Concerning the Cradock Collection of Sermons.\" Ranney notes that five Cradock sermons were in the Maryland Diocesan Archives since the Rev. Ethan Allen obtained them in the nineteenth century. The bulk of the sermons were obtained in March, 1971 from the Rev. Thomas Cradock Jensen (who was not related to Thomas Cradock), through the work of Professor Skaggs. Professor Skaggs worked on the sermons briefly, and during which time, he sorted the sermons according to author. He identified many of the sermons as having been written by Cradock, while others were identified as written by the Rev. John Wilkinson and preached by Cradock at St. Thomas church. Skaggs' identification was further complicated because Cradock suffered a paralysis sometime around 1763, and he used an amanuensis for the rest of his life. Skaggs' division of sermons is generally retained in this bibliography. F. Garner Ranney also sorted through, reconstructed and identified other sermons, complete or partial, as having been preached or written by Cradock. The sermons cataloged here represent complete sermons or partial sermons that include the first page. These entries included those that clearly were written by Cradock as well as those that either demonstrate evidence of having been preached by Cradock or which Skaggs identified as having been preached by him. Also included here are those sermons clearly written by Wilkinson but which contain dating that indicates having been delivered by Cradock. In addition to these complete sermons, significant fragments are included in the collection that have not been cataloged.

The remaining six names and dates are as follows, with each name and date given their own line:  \"Capt. Wm.

The manuscript is a funeral sermon for a woman who died of \"palsy.\"  The deceased is not named, but may be the first of the unreadable names.  On page 30 of the sermon proper, Clay notes of the deceased \"to whom I was almost a Stranger,\" and then refers to \"his Character.\"  This section of four lines is blocked within drawn lines and likely indicates a subsequent, different use of this sermon.  The blocked section contains the only references to a deceased person as male, though Clay certainly would convert his statements for each funeral.

According to Greenâ€™s manuscript journal of the trip (see accession number 4065), he â€œSet out from Trentonâ€ on November 1, 1762 and â€œAr[r]ived at Hanoverâ€ on November  12, 1762 (p. 1).  He returned to New Jersey according to his â€œJournalâ€ six months later:  â€œ[May] 13 [1763] arived at Rev Mr Finleys at Head of Elk.â€ (p. 9) for a Synod.  William Tennent, Jr. was also expected to make such a missionary trip, but apparently never did.  <i>Records of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America</i> (1904; rpt. New York:  Arno Press, 1969) records on May 20, 1763, that â€œMr. Green fulfilled his appointments to Virginia.   Mr. William Tennent, jun. not fulfilling his, is excused.â€ (p. 325).  The volumeâ€™s index contains 21 other references to Green in the records.  [See also Alfred Nevin, ed., <i>Encyclopedia of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America:  Including the Northern and Southern Assemblies</i> (Philadelphia:  Presbyterian Encyclopedia Publishing Company, 1884, 276.]  The material at Rutgers, which includes â€œA Journal of my Mission to Virginia,â€ also includes notes on the collection by Donald Sinclair, Rutgersâ€™ first head of Special Collections citing the strong chain of evidence for the attribution of these works to Green.  According to Keith L. Griffin, the author of <i>Revolution and Religion:  American Revolutionary War and the Reformed Clergy</i> (New York:  Paragon House, 1994), Green  went beyond most ministers to claim that the colonists would succeed in the Revolution  because as Whigs they were the inheritors of the English Puritan revolution against the Tories, but later modified his claim as to the historical source of rights (pp. 57-58).  See also Joseph S. Tiedemann, â€œPresbyterianism and the American Revolution in the Middle Colonies,â€ <i>Church History</i> 74: 2 (2005), 322.  More information on Green can be found online at http://home.comcast.net/~williamgreenhouse/gen/40.hyml.  The Beatty Family Collection in the Special Collections of Princeton University (Mss. C1010, box 1, folder 2) has a leaf noting that Green was â€œdismissed from N Brunswick Presbytery April 22d. 1767â€”to join the Presbytery of Philadelphia.â€  The same collection holds two 1774 letters of the Rev. Charles C. Beatty to Green (Box 1, folders 5 and 6), a 1772 letter of John Beatty to Green and his family (Box 1, folder 7), and R. Beattyâ€™s  1775 letter to Green on Tories and tea (Box 1, folder 19).  Princetonâ€™s Hunter Family Collection (Mss. C1086, Box1, folder 1) contains a 1770 letter to Green from the Rev. Andrew Hunter.   Green also evidently ran a teaching academy at which Joseph Bloomfield, Governor of New Jersey (1801-1812) and later general and congressman, was educated (online finding aid, Princeton University Mss. Collection C1001).  Green eventually served as a chaplain in the Revolutionary War with Washingtonâ€™s troops at Fort Washington in New York City, but contracted camp fever.  Returning to New Jersey, he died on December 2, 1776.  A 1772 printed sermon of Greenâ€™s that survives is <i>Slothfulness reproved, and The Example of the Saints proposed for Imitation:  A Sermon, Occasioned by the Death of the Reverend Mr. William Ramsay, Who departed this Life November 5, 1771.  In the 39th Year of his Age.  Delivered at Fairfield in Cohansie, December 9, 1771.</i>  (Philadelphia:  Printed by D. Hall, and W. Sellers, in Market-street, MDCCLXXII).  Greenâ€™s text is â€œHebrews vi. 12.â€ and the sermon is available online (and in other forms of the Evans Early American Imprints, Series I , no. 12407) at http://opac.newsbank.com/select/evans/12407.

This manuscript is included in the bibliography since these materials demonstrate the training Green had and likely undergird the development of his sermons.

Addresses to the Continental Army]","","","","","","","","1775","","1775","20pp.","","","Cataloged as one sermon, these three addresses are not southern or technically a sermon (no Biblical text is cited as the text for preaching), but the item  is included to help flesh out the canon of Greenâ€™s works.  His record of service and death date the clearly patriotic manuscript to 1775-1776.  In his <i>Revolution and Religion:  American Revolutionary War and the Reformed Clergy</i> (New York:  Paragon House, 1994), Keith L. Griffin considers the work a single sermon and dates it to 1776 (p. 105, n. 17).  Greenâ€™s letter to his father, quoted in part below, may argue for a dating of 1775.  And, although cataloged and protectively sleeved as one work, it may in fact be three.  The first, that begins with the words â€œAt a Day of publick Danger & Calam[ity],â€ is complete in 8 pages, notes Greenâ€™s appointment as chaplain, and it concludes occupying only the top half of the eighth page.  The second, which is on slightly larger paper and initially written in the same but larger hand with more space between the lines, begins with â€œWe [symbol for â€œareâ€] now reduced to the dreadful Necess[ity] to determine [symbol for â€œthisâ€] Contest by ye Swordâ€ and may be complete or be the final four pages of a different address.  The third possible address is written on paper that is 1 Â½â€ shorter in length than the others.  It begins with â€œIt must afford great Pleas[ure] to every Lover of his Count. [Country]â€ and may be complete or be the final pages of a different address.  It concludes occupying only the top quarter of the final page.  The latter two works, if fragmentary, may be sermons, but unless beginning pages with Biblical texts are found, the more likely possibility remains that inscribed on these twenty pages are three distinct addresses.  This folder also contains a letter from Green to his father William (whose address is â€œTrentonâ€) that was written from â€œDeerfield 10th of September 1775.â€  It is, in effect a last goodbye and will.  He begins the letter â€œI am now reduced Very weak and low, and do soon expect to leave this World, My Wife a Disconsolate Widow and two Fatherless Children, whom I recommend to Divine Providence and Your Care.â€  He left New York and returned to New Jersey, dying on December 2, 1776.
